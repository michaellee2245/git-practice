Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. Now it's beginning to make a little sense.

This is the way you take out your flustrations. I like to beat the brush. In your world you have total and absolute power. Let's have a happy little tree in here. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. Let's make a happy little mountain now.

Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Let's get crazy. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. Let's have a nice tree right here.

In life you need colors. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. There comes a nice little fluffer.

The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Let your imagination be your guide. We'll make some happy little bushes here.

Mountains are so simple, they're hard. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. It all happens automatically. Don't be bashful drop me a line.
